# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Summary
In this analysis, we used Python in Jupyter Notebook to retrieve and use data from an API request to a server. We retrieved and stored values from a JSON array to help build our desired maps. We built scatter plots using Matplotlib library, displaying various styles and features. Lastly, we created heatmaps and added markers using Google Maps API.

## Challenge Summary
With the programming skills that were developed, we updated the “Plan My Trip app” application by adding the weather description to the data that was pulled. We also used input statements to filter the data for the weather preference of users and the potential to identify travel destinations with nearby hotels. Using Google Maps Directions API, we created a potential travel destination with a travel route of four cities.
